To use these minecraft programs:

TO FOLLOW THIS GUIDE EXACTLY, you should extract the zip file i sent and copy/paste 
the "minecraft-pi" folder to the Raspberry Pi Desktop folder.



1. Run Minecraft Pi as usual
2. Create a new world amd let it load
3. Press [TAB] to regain control of your mouse outside of the minecraft window
4. Open a command terminal (taskbar icon), or  [CTRL]+[ALT]+[T]
5. Type "cd Desktop"       (change directory to desktop)
6. Type "ls"               (show the files within)
7. Type "cd minecraft-pi"  (now you are in the python - minecraft programs folder)
8. Type "ls"               (to see the names of the programs)
9. Type "python template.py" (to test the connection - you should see a message in minecraft)


Quick and very basic terminal commands for use with this:

ls                             = list directory (show contents)
ls [name-of-folder]            = list a more specific directory
cd [name-of-folder]            = change directory (move forward one folder)
cd ..                          = change back to the previous directory
python [name-of-file.py]       = run a python program - must end in .py
idle [name-of-file.py]         = edit a python program with IDLE


Make your own huge names:

1. Open or edit maketextbig.py in IDLE (idle maketextbig.py) or right click the file and 
edit with IDLE. 

2. Scroll to the red comment where I wrote about changing the text file

3. You are going to make your own HUGE picture and the filename.txt will go into the code
and replace demo.txt

4. Keep the python file open and minimise it for now (maketextbig.py)

5. Create a new text file

6. We are going to represent minecraft blocks with different letters.
s = stone block
g = glass block
t = tnt explosives blocks
x = wood clocks
try to make a shape in your text file using the above letters

7. Save your new text art file as (myhugetext.txt)

8 Open up the python file you minimised (maketextbig.py) and replace the filename demo.txt 
on line 51 for your new filename (myhugetext.txt) then save it.

9. When you run this program with minecraft open you will see your new artwork in the game!
